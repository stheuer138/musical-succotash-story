	This is the beginning to the story our xteam will be developing. The character we will write about is named Hansel and he lives in Wakanda. 
He enjoys going for walks around the countryside.
	One day, while going on his usual walk, he notices a glimmering purple light from the trees on his right. At the base of a tree he finds an
amethyst-like stone, seeming to hold great power. He rushes back to the Citadel to tell his father. He enters the throne room, where the Tribal
Council meeting has already begun. "You're late," said T'Challa. "I'm sorry, Father. My usual walk was prolonged by the discovery of something I 
think could be very important to us. Here, look." T'Challa's eyes widen as Hansel opens his hand to reveal the stone. "My son, you were right to bring
this to me. For this is not just any stone. It is the Soul Stone."

"What is Soul Stone father?" Asked by Hansel. "My son, Soul Stone is the most powerful stone in the world, the one who owns it, owns the world. Let me show you how." T'Challa holded the stone with his right hand
and start to spell. Suddenly, something happens.
